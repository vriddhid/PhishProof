# PhishProof
The Internet has become an effective channel for social interactions now-a-days. Peopleâ€™s immense dependence on digital platforms opens doors for fraud. Phishing is a type of cybercrime to steal users credentials from online platforms such as online banking, online business,etc. Phishing website detection can help the users to avoid falling victim to these attacks. Although phishing websites are disguised as legitimate ones, fortunately they have some identifiable features.
We will be implementing this in a data-driven framework for detecting phishing webpages using a deep learning approach.
Using Artificial Neural Network model, to check whether a website is suspected to be a Phishing attack. Phishing attacks are a serious threat to individuals and organizations, and they continue to evolve and become more sophisticated.
The traditional methods of detecting phishing attacks rely on rule-based systems, which are not always effective in identifying new and unknown types of attacks. Deep learning techniques, such as neural networks, have shown great potential in detecting phishing attacks by learning from large datasets and identifying patterns in the data.
